  //Destructuring also works in arrays
  //when pulling from an array, use [ ] to destructure
  //when pulling from an object, use { } to destructure

  const details = ['Wes Bos', 123, 'wesbos.com'];
  
  //old way
  //const name = details[0];

  //based on index value want to get data out
  //takes first, second and third thing in details and make variables
  const [name, id, website] = details;
  console.log(name, id, website);

  //data is in a string but with a perfect separator ','
  const data = 'Basketball,Sports,90210,23,wes,bos,cool';
  //array destructuring from is built on the fly by splitting the data string
  const [itemName, category, sku, inventory] = data.split(',');
  //will create 4 variables destructuring from an array
  console.log(itemName, category, sku, inventory);

  //nothing happens if you destructure an array or object that is not the same length
  //it will just throw those other one's out and not set them to anything unless 
  //you do a catch all or rest operator
  const team = ['Wes', 'Harry', 'Sarah', 'Keegan', 'Riker'];

  //rest operator ... gives you the rest 
  const [captain, assistant, ...players] = team;
  //captain = Wes
  //assistant = Harry
  //players = ['Sarah', 'Keegan', 'Riker'] -- the rest of the items
